# Erik's ICS-4U Portfolio

This is a collection of the work I've done during my final year of Computer Science at A.Y. Jackson. Here you can find some of 
my best projects across different platforms, as well as personal reflections of my work.


## Khan Academy
### 1. Basic HTML/CSS

  Working with HTML is how I decided to continue with computer science, while working through I realized how working with websites and coding in general was interesting. I thought it was a great way to start getting into a coding mind set and learning how to work with code productively. Thanks to those basic skills I was able to understand working basically with webpages, and even creating my own.
### 2. Basic Js(JavaScript)

  Javascript was really important for my last year of high school due to it being our main language. However it's also one of the most important languages. Which is why this module was important. Thanks to the lessons I learned in basic Js I now know basic coding that I was later able to develop into the more advanced code I know now.
### 3. Natural Simulations

  Without a doubt the hardest and more important course I took. Natural Simulations included many concepts used in real world physics and math that I was then taught how to apply to coding. Although it was hard to learn in a shorter period of time now at the end of it I am extremely thankful that I understand many of the things taught such as object-oriented coding that I will come across again in my future education and career.
### 4. Algorithms

  Algorithms have been one of the biggest aspects of computer science but up until now I haven't been able to fully visualize what it looked like in code. This module taught me all sorts of algorithms like selection sort and pseudo code and now feel good about continuing my education with it.

## P5.js
### 9. Bees and Bombs(Coding Challenge)

  For our summative we chose Dan Shiffmans coding challenge "Bees and Bombs" this was fun because it was a group project and we got to code as a team as well as creating our first 3-D appearence. We then also got to teach what we did and learned, which was awesome because we were able to hardwire most of the information into our minds. Definitely one of the top learning experiences of the year.
### 10. Math Rose

  A cool project thet introduced us to adjusting variables to change images on screen. Also a great leraning experience on coding sliders, a great example of input. The combination of math and computer science is a wonderful provides a great way to learn how to manipulate the two to create something interesting.
