# Erik's ICS-4U Portfolio

My name's Erik Menhart, I'm a student about to graduate from A.Y. Jackson High School. I plan on studying computer science at Nipissing University. In this portfolio you can find some of my best work that I did in grade 12 computer science. You can also see some of the modules I've worked through my years included with personal responces based on what I've learned. Here you will be able to see what I'm experienced with and some of my work.


## Khan Academy
### 1. Basic HTML/CSS

  Working with HTML is how I decided to continue with computer science, while working through I realized how working with websites and coding in general was interesting. I thought it was a great way to start getting into a coding mind set and learning how to work with code productively. Thanks to those basic skills I was able to understand working basically with webpages, and even creating my own.

### 2. Basic Js(JavaScript)

  Javascript was really important for my last year of high school due to it being our main language. However it's also one of the most important languages. Which is why this module was important. Thanks to the lessons I learned in basic Js I now know basic coding that I was later able to develop into the more advanced code I know now.

### 3. Natural Simulations

  Without a doubt the hardest and more important course I took. Natural Simulations included many concepts used in real world physics and math that I was then taught how to apply to coding. Although it was hard to learn in a shorter period of time now at the end of it I am extremely thankful that I understand many of the things taught such as object-oriented coding that I will come across again in my future education and career.

### 4. Algorithms

  Algorithms have been one of the biggest aspects of computer science but up until now I haven't been able to fully visualize what it looked like in code. This module taught me all sorts of algorithms like selection sort and pseudo code and now feel good about continuing my education with it.

### 5. Making Websites interactive

  This module taught a much more advanced way of coding html, this allowed a much more complex way to work with websites. It allows for creating a much more advanced and interactive website. Learning things like how to make a slideshow or utelize buttons and such on screen. It also showed me how to combine Html with other languages that we've used, which will be useful in future website building.

## Free Code Camp
### 6. Debbuging

  This is a great course as it gives you a great understanding of how to identify the problems and errors in code and what to do to rectify the issues. This was useful for my studies this year and in the future as now I can keep my code cleaner with fewer syntax errors, and if needed I can identify errors in the code. Lastly I am able to debbug the code appropriately.

### 7. Basic Data Structres

  The Basic Data Structres module gives a thorough lesson about arrays and how to manipulate them to your effectiveness. It was very good at quickly and cleanly showing you how to work with arrays in a all types of scenarios. However some of the later lessons weren't working properly and would allow me to continue.

### 8. Basic Algorithm Scrpiting

  A fantastic continuation of basic algorithm, learning more algorithm scripting is really benificial due to my future in computer science. I found this module much better then khan academy as it gives you a chance to run through so many scenarios and figure out how to solve each of them. Very helpful towards understanding what algorithms are and why they're important for computer science.

### 9. Bees and Bombs(Coding Challenge)

  For our summative we chose Dan Shiffmans coding challenge "Bees and Bombs" this was fun because it was a group project and we got to code as a team as well as creating our first 3-D appearence. We then also got to teach what we did and learned, which was awesome because we were able to hardwire most of the information into our minds. Definitely one of the top learning experiences of the year.

### 10. Math Rose

  A cool project thet introduced us to adjusting variables to change images on screen. Also a great leraning experience on coding sliders, a great example of input. The combination of math and computer science is a wonderful provides a great way to learn how to manipulate the two to create something interesting.
